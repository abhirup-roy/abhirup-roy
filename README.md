## Who am I?

A profound question but...

Long story short, I am a Chemical Engineering PhD student looking at using Discrete Element Modelling (_DEM_) and Machine Learning (_ML_) to predict the manufacturability of active pharmaceutical ingredients (_APIs_). My PhD is in conjunction with CDT Formulation Engineering (University of Birmingham) and AstraZeneca.
